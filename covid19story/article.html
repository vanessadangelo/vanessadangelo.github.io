            <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 has killed more than 980,000 people in the United States, making it a leading cause of death.</p>
            <p>Everyone age 5 and older in the United States can get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
            <p>People ages 5–17 can only get a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.</p>


          <p> If you’re age 18 or older, you can choose which COVID-19 vaccine to get. </p>
          <p> There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines will cause long-term health problems. </p>
          <p>Vaccines are the correct path to immunity than the disease itself. </p>

<p>It is clear how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed in health care practices. Today, masks are advised for all patients when entering a hospital. Personally, if you are fully vaccinated I believe masks are not needed in hospitals because years ago it was not necessary and even though the pandemic will be ending shortly, I believe normalcy is necessary for people to move on from the traumatic time. I understand people may find it difficult to not wear a mask in a healthcare setting, but dwelling over COVID-19 where the new strand most likely causes a mild illness is not necessary and dramatic. If you still are not vaccinated, mask must be required in all indoor and outdoor settings because one it makes it more likely for an unvaccinated person to get the virus, two it can cause the person to become severely sick from not getting vaccinated, and three it causes vaccinated people to feel uncomfortable and exposed.

    <h1>WHY DOES COVID-19 HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS TOWARDS CERTAIN AGE DEMOGRAPHICS? </h1>
    <p> In 2020, a sustained resurgence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) surfaced in the United States. Throughout the epidemic, a severe increase of mortality occurred due to the affects the disease had on an individual. When coronavirus enters the body, it goes towards the healthy cells and uses its infectious machinery to make those cells a virus particle. When a cell becomes infected by the virus, it begins to break open, which leads the cells to die and causes a transfer of the virus particle to infect more cells. The reason why COVID-19 affects certain people is because it is connected to inflammation in two ways. Every individual has a different immune response which is why the virus reacts evil towards people of higher levels of inflammation.</p>

<h3>
   INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR BRIAN HUMMEL
 </h3>


    <p>
Last week, I interviewed Doctor Brian Hummel who is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. We discussed over zoom about how COVID-19 has affected his hospital. Hummel explains how the pandemic transformed every hospital across the country. Changes have been made in his hospital to reduce spread of infections and to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases that can come this way.In many ways the pandemic highlighted what it means to work together. Doctor Hummel said collaboration and advancing medical ideas on how to corporate the necessities was how they would work together in the hospital during rapid cases of the virus. He began to describe the hardships of communicating with his colleagues with masks and body covers to make sure they would not get infected by the disease. The pandemic brought light to many issues such as racial and socio-economic problems in care within their community.
</p>

    <p>I have learned that rapid new technology is being released within healthcare and it is expected to bring huge transformations that will change people's perspectives on hospitals. The pandemic has brought light by creating new changes within hospitals all over the world. </p>

<p>
Over the semester, I have done constant research of the statistics behind age groups who were affected by COVID-19. Below is a bar table I created that displays the data I analyzed.

            <p>The pie chart shows how racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have similar rates of both infection and death compared to white people. Many people wonder why racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to get a severe case of COVID-19, but having an underlying illness changes one's reaction. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#:~:text=Older%20adults%20are%20at%20highest,18%2D29%20years"> CDC.gov </a> ,more than 81% of COVID-19 deaths occur in people over the age of 65.</p>

            <p>The pie chart shows how racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have higher rates of both infection and death compared to white people. Many people wonder why white people do have a smaller percentage of dying from COVID-19, but it dates back to the popular illnesses. According to <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/health_disparities_among_african_americans">Pfizer</a>, African Americans are generally at higher risk for heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza, pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS.</p>

            <p>Other minorities are also affected by COVID-19, such as Hispanics.The pie chart displays the last two years and that 224 people, who range from the ages 5 to 18, have died from COVID-19. It is clear that a total of 778 deaths is quite small for a two year period of a pandemic, but it is depressing knowing innocent young lives are being taken by a worldwide virus.
            </p>



            <p>The pandemic has impacted the whole world. As of now, the pandemic is slowing down compared to its first stages when it arrived in the United States. My data shows that all ages groups can die from the virus. Even though it is constantly highlighted on the news how middle age and up become severely affected, there is no reasonto down play other age groups that are also receiving COVID-19. </p>
