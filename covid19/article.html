            <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 has killed more than 980,000 people in the United States, making it a leading cause of death.</p>
            <p>Everyone age 5 and older in the United States can get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
            <p>People ages 5–17 can only get a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.</p>


          <p> If you’re age 18 or older, you can choose which COVID-19 vaccine to get. </p>
          <p> There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines will cause long-term health problems. </p>
          <p>Vaccines are the correct paths to immunity than the disease itself. </p>

<p>It is clear how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed in health care practices. Today, masks are advised for all patients when entering a hospital. Personally, if you are fully vaccinated I believe masks are not needed in hospitals because years ago it was not necessary and even though the pandemic will be ending shortly, I believe normalcy is necessary for people to move on from the traumatic time. I understand people may find it difficult to not wear a mask in a healthcare setting, but dwelling over COVID-19 where the new strand most likely causes a mild illness is not necessary and dramatic. If you still are not vaccinated, mask must be required in all indoor and outdoor settings because one it makes it more likely for an unvaccinated person to get the virus, two it can cause the person to become severely sick from not getting vaccinated, and three it causes vaccinated people to feel uncomfortable and exposed.

    <h1>Why does the virus have different reactions towards different age demographics? </h1>
    <p> In 2020, a sustained resurgence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) surfaced in the United States. Throughout the epidemic, a severe increase of mortality occurred due to the affects the disease had on an individual. When coronavirus enters the body, it goes towards the healthy cells and uses its infectious machinery to make those cells a virus particle. When a cell becomes infected by the virus, it begins to break open, which leads the cells to die and causes a transfer of the virus particle to infect more cells. The reason why COVID-19 affects certain people is because it is connected to inflammation in two ways. Every individual has a different immune response which is why the virus reacts evil towards people of higher levels of inflammation.</p>

<h3>
   INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR BRIAN HUMMEL
 </h3>


    <p>
Last week, I interviewed Doctor Brian Hummel who is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. We discussed over zoom about how COVID-19 has affected his hospital. Hummel explains how the pandemic transformed every hospital across the country. Changes have been made in his hospital to reduce spread of infections and to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases that can come this way.In many ways the pandemic highlighted what it means to work together. Doctor Hummel said collaboration and advancing medical ideas on how to corporate the necessities was how they would work together in the hospital during rapid cases of the virus. He began to describe the hardships of communicating with his colleagues with masks and body covers to make sure they would not get infected by the disease. The pandemic brought light to many issues such as racial and socio-economic problems in care within their community.
</p>

    <p>I have learned that rapid new technology is being released within healthcare and it is expected to bring huge transformations that will change people's perspectives on hospitals. The pandemic has brought light by creating new changes within hospitals all over the world. </p>

<p>
Over the semester, I have done constant research of the statistics behind age groups who were affected by COVID-19. Below is a bar table I created that displays the data I analyzed.

            <p>The chart shows how age groups become affected in the United States during the prime of COVID-19. As you can see, deaths occurred between all age groups. The 75 years old and over category had the most with a total of 509,449 deaths in the last two years. This makes sense because the elderly are the most vulnerable when it comes to a disease. Elders most likely have underlying health conditions and when the virus gets into their system it develops a severe illness due to the physiological changes that come with aging. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#:~:text=Older%20adults%20are%20at%20highest,18%2D29%20years"> CDC.gov </a> ,more than 81% of COVID-19 deaths occur in people over the age of 65.</p>
